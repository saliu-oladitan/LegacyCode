<!--------1. Web form image not showing on IIS------>
Question
I have placed an image on the master page.

I see the image at design time.

But I don't see the image at run time.

What can be the problem?

I have tried to place the image on an image box. But it didn't work either.




Solution: 

I think your image files are not accessible on runtime.

Just paste this code in your web.config file and the images will be displayed.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/.NetConfiguration/v2.0">
<system.web>
<authorization>
<allow users="*" />
</authorization>
</system.web>
</configuration>
